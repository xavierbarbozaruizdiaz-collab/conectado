## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and reliability, which are important for e-commerce.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF) will keep the design feeling airy and uncluttered.
- Accent color: Use a contrasting orange (#FF8C00) to highlight key interactive elements, particularly calls to action.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral and objective look, appropriate for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for categories, profile actions, and dashboard elements.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure consistency across all pages. Prioritize clear visual hierarchy, especially within the dashboards.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states, transitions, and user interactions (e.g., a smooth progress bar during bidding).
